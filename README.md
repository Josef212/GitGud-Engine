<h1>GitGud-Engine</h1>

<p>GitGud is an OpenGL engine done for educational purposes as a continuation of <a href="https://github.com/Josef212/JayEngine">JayEngine</a> done for the game engine assignement.</p>
<p>The engine is still in a really early state but will be working on my free time.</p>

<h3>v0.1.5</h3>
<p>First engine version, basic structure is created to build the engine on it.</p>
<p>Current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default shader loaded and a cube displayed in origin. This is just for test so is not linked to game object system.</li>
<li>Basic game object system with components. Hierarchy and inspector display objects information.</li>
<li>Editor camera. Move it using WASD, RF and right click + drag to rotate.(Rotating is still a bit bad but working on it)</li>
<li>Scene(fbx, obj, ...) and texture importers to own formats.</li>
<li>Scene save and load. Still not full functionality but can serialize current game objects and load them later.</li>
<li>Simple console. Type "help" to display all commands.</li>
<li>Some app configuration.</li>
<li>UI style editor.</li>
</ul>
